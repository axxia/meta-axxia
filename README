========

This is the official OpenEmbedded/Yocto BSP layer for LSI’s family of
Axxia Mobile & Enterprise Communication Processors.


Supported MACHINES
------------------

Boards Supported by this layer (Please refer to the associate .conf for more
information):

	* axxiapowerpc - Axxia 3000 PPC Mobile & Enterprise Communication 
                        Processors family

	* axxiaarm - Axxia 5000 ARM Mobile & Enterprise Communication

	* axxiaarm64 - Axxia 5000 ARM Mobile & Enterprise Communication 
                    Processors family 

NOTE: Machines are divided by architecture. By building Linux for axxiaarm 
machine (e.g.), you will build binaries for all available ARM targets.

Building the meta-axxia BSP layer
-------------------------------

To begin using the Yocto Project build tools, you must first setup your work
environment and verify that that you have the required host packages installed
on the system you will be using for builds. 

Check the YOCTO Reference Manual for the system you are using and verify you
have the minimum required packages installed. 
http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/ref-manual/ref-manual.html

NOTE: You may also require packages: u-boot-tools (mkimage) and
device-tree-compiler (dtc)

1. Create an empty build directory and verify that the partition has at least
50Gb of free space. Next set an environment variable, YOCTO, to the full path.

   $ cd $HOME
   $ df -h .  # verify output shows adequate space available
   $ mkdir yocto
   $ cd yocto
   $ export YOCTO=$HOME/yocto # should also add this to your ~/.bashrc file. 

2. Clone the Yocto Project build tools (Poky) environment.

   $ cd $YOCTO
   $ git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky.git
   $ cd poky
   $ git checkout master

3. Clone the LSI meta layer. This provides meta data for building images for the
LSI specific board types.

   $ cd $YOCTO/poky
   $ git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-axxia
   $ cd meta-axxia
   $ git checkout yocto-1.9

4. The Open Embedded project provides many useful layers and packages such as
networking. Download the Open Embedded Yocto Project hosted repository with the
following.

   $ cd $YOCTO/poky
   $ git clone https://github.com/openembedded/meta-oe.git
   $ cd meta-oe
   $ git checkout master

5. Create the build directory. The name is optional and will default to 'build',
however it helps to choose a name to match the board type. For example, we will
use axxia.

   $ cd $YOCTO
   $ source poky/oe-init-build-env axxia

6. Edit the conf/bblayers.conf file

   $ pwd (you should be at $YOCTO/axxia)
   $ vi conf/bblayers.conf

Edit BBLAYERS variable as follows. Replace references to $YOCTO below with the
actual value you provided in step 1.

   BBLAYERS ?= " \
            $YOCTO/poky/meta \
            $YOCTO/poky/meta-yocto \
            $YOCTO/poky/meta-yocto-bsp \
            $YOCTO/poky/meta-oe/meta-oe \
            $YOCTO/poky/meta-oe/meta-python \
            $YOCTO/poky/meta-oe/meta-networking \
            $YOCTO/poky/meta-axxia \
            "

7. Edit the conf/local.conf file:
   $ vi conf/local.conf

7.1 Depending on your processor, set these two options that control how much
parallelism BitBake should use:

  BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "12"
  PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j 12"

7.2 Select a specific machine to target the build with:

  MACHINE = "axxiaarm"
  or
  MACHINE = "axxiaarm64"
  or
  MACHINE = "axxiapowerpc"

7.3 Select the root filesystem image compression type (can set multiple types):

  IMAGE_FSTYPES += "ext2"
  IMAGE_FSTYPES += "tar.gz"

7.4 Select the custom bootloader as preferred:

  PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/bootloader = "u-boot-lsi"

7.5 Select the KERNEL type:
   for standard
   PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel = "linux-yocto"

   for preempt-rt
   PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel = "linux-yocto-rt"

7.6 Select the KERNEL version:
NOTE: axxiaarm and axxiapowerpc are available only with linux 3.14
      axxiaarm64 is available only with linux 4.1

   for 3.14, depending on PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel
   PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-yocto = "3.14%"
   PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-yocto-rt = "3.14%"

   for 4.1, depending on PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel
   PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-yocto = "4.1%"
   PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-yocto-rt = "4.1%"
  
7.7 Select the KERNEL repository to use. Meta-lsi is able to build the kernel 
from 2 sources: GITHUB private and YOCTO kernel repo depending on LSI_SRC
variable from local.conf:

a. by default (missing to set LSI_SRC) or setting

   LSI_SRC = "linux-yocto"

   will build from Yocto repos:
   3.14: http://git.yoctoproject.org/git/linux-yocto-3.14
   4.1:  http://git.yoctoproject.org/git/linux-yocto-4.1 

b. LSI_SRC = "lsi-tip"
   
   will build kernel from GitHub private repos (require authentication):
   3.14: git@github.com:lsigithub/axxia_yocto_linux_3.14_private.git
   4.1:  git@github.com:lsigithub/axxia_yocto_linux_4.1_private.git

7.8 Customizing the Kernel .config file
NOTE: This options are available only with LSI_SRC = "linux-yocto"
      When building from github, fixed defconfigs are used instead.

When building the kernel from the Yocto repositories, the final .config is built
using configuration fragments. Otherwise, a pre-built defconfig is used.
Besides the options specific to the standard and preempt-rt kernel, you are able
to add extra kernel fragments by setting the following options

a. Power management scheme (axxiaarm only)
   - POWER_MANAGEMENT = "low-power" (DEFAULT)
     to keep the core low power when is shut down
   - POWER_MANAGEMENT = "full-power"
     to complete power down the core when is shut down
   - POWER_MANAGEMENT = "full-power-L2"
     to complete power down the core and L2 cache when is shut down

b. Regression testing
    TESTING = "yes"

7.9 Other optional settings for saving disk space and build time:
   
   DL_DIR = "/<some-shared-location>/downloads"
   SSTATE_DIR = "/<some-shared-location>/sstate-cache

7.10. Example. Append these lines to conf/local.conf file from the build dir

BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "12"
PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j 12"
MACHINE = "axxiaarm64"
IMAGE_FSTYPES += "ext2"
IMAGE_FSTYPES += "tar.gz"
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/bootloader = "u-boot-lsi"
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel = "linux-yocto"
PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-yocto = "4.1%"
LSI_SRC = "lsi-tip"
DL_DIR = "/<some-shared-location>/downloads"
SSTATE_DIR = "/<some-shared-location>/sstate-cache"


8. Select the image type and start the build
   $ cd $YOCTO/axxia
   $ bitbake <image type>

Available root filesystem types:
   * axxia-image-small 
     A small image for use in simulation, flash, or as a ram disk. Should be
     sufficient to use the RTE. 

   * axxia-image-sim 
     An image for use in simulation. 

   * axxia-image-large
     A more complete image.

Once complete the images for the target machine will be available in the output
directory 'tmp/deploy/images/$MACHINE'.

9. Images generated:

* <image type>-<machine name>.ext2 (rootfs in EXT2 format)
* <image type>-<machine name>.tar.gz (rootfs in tar+GZIP format)
* modules-<machine name>.tgz (modules in tar+GZIP format)
* zImage and zImage-<machine name> (Linux Kernel binary, in u-boot wrapped 
format)
NOTE: For axxiaarm64, only Image files are generated, instead of zImage.
      Use mkimage to convert them to zImage format. 
* <target name>.dtb
* FIT images, 3 types:
	* fdt.fit-<target name> (DTB in fit image format)
	* linux.fit-<target name> (Kernel binary in fit image format)
	* multi.fit-<target name> (Kernel binary + DTB in fit image format)
